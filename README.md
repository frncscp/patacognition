This models were trained between 1000 and 10000 images, equally divived in two classes: Patacón-True and Patacón-False. 
Anything that could create a bias towards a feature that could confuse the model was emphasized on specific data fed to the False class.
A greater number doesn't correlate with a better performance, it's a cronological order, but later versions are better than the early ones.
